<p><strong>hacker, n:</strong> One who is intensely interested in learning and
    modifying the technical aspects of a system, particularly a computer and
    its software; one who hacks; a computer programmer who is largely or
    completely self-taught.</p>
<p>
    CWRU Hacker Society is a common ground for those who are interested in
    digging into the innards of things; for those who use, produce, or
    support open-source software (or hardware); and for those who would like
    to learn more about open-source development.</p>
